# SpeakLift - Technical Architecture

## System Overview

SpeakLift is an iOS application that leverages the ChatGPT API to provide real-time conversational English practice with grammar correction. The system architecture is designed to ensure responsive performance, efficient API usage, and a seamless user experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Layer

- **UI Components**: SwiftUI views for conversation interface
- **Audio Processing**: AVFoundation integration for audio recording and playback
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI realtime Recognition framework for converting speech to text

### 2. Application Layer

- **Conversation Manager**: Handles the flow of conversation between user and AI

- **Session Controller**: Manages practice sessions and tracks user progress
- **Topic Generator**: Suggests conversation topics based on user proficiency

### 3. API Integration Layer

- **OpenAI Service**: Manages communication with the ChatGPT API
- **Response Parser**: Processes API responses into appropriate UI elements
- **Error Handler**: Manages API errors and fallback strategies

### 4. Data Layer

- **Conversation Repository**: Stores conversation history
- **User Profile Manager**: Maintains user preferences and progress data
- **Error Pattern Analyzer**: Tracks common mistakes for targeted practice

## API Integration Design

## Data Flow

1. **Speech Input**: User speaks into the device
2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Chatgpt Realtime API converts audio to text
3. **API Request**: Text is sent to ChatGPT API (gpt-4o-mini) with appropriate prompt
5. **Response Processing**: App parses API response and formats for display


## Performance Optimization

### API Usage Efficiency

- **Streaming Responses**: Utilize streaming API capabilities for real-time feedback
- **Context Management**: Optimize token usage by managing conversation context
- **Caching**: Cache common corrections and responses to reduce API calls

### Latency Reduction

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle API requests asynchronously to maintain UI responsiveness
- **Connection Management**: Implement robust handling of network conditions
- **Background Processing**: Perform intensive tasks in background threads

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Storage**: Secure storage of API credentials using Keychain
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive user data and conversation history
- **Privacy Controls**: Clear user controls for data retention and sharing

## Error Handling

- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation during connectivity issues
- **API Limitations**: Handle rate limiting and token quota management
- **Recognition Errors**: Strategies for handling speech recognition inaccuracies

## Scalability

- **Model Versioning**: Architecture to support updates to underlying AI models
- **Feature Expansion**: Modular design to accommodate additional language learning features
- **User Growth**: Infrastructure considerations for increased user base
